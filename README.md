# time-tracker-react-native
A react-native client for the time tracker system

This will become the Android/iOS client for tracking hours for contract work (or anything that needs hours tracked based on project separation)

There's not a whole lot going on now, but you can still clone and take a look if you'd like

### Instructions
1. Setup your dev environment according to the [React Native Docs](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html)
  * I'm using `react-native-cli` so you should set it up by way of the 'With Native Code' tab on the main page
2. `git clone` this repo
3. `yarn install` the dependencies (or `npm install` if you prefer)
4. Assuming you're using `react-native-cli`, run `react-native start` to start the packager running
  * If you're running on Linux or Windows, in a separate terminal run `react-native run-android` (Assuming you've setup your environment according to the [React Native Docs](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html))
  * Or on OSX, in a separate terminal to you started in step 4, run either `react-native run-ios` or `react-native run-android`. Whichever you'd like to work on.

*NOTE:* I'll mostly be developing on the Android side as I've got a physical Android phone. I'll be using XCode's Simulator to run the app on iPhone simulations on my Hackintosh or Macbook, but when the time is right I'll need someone with an iPhone to help with actually running the app on real hardware :)
